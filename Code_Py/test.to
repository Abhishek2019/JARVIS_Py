No kids, and I do the same stuff... Except to 'watch their little faces light up' I put LEDs in the faces of stuffed animals.  Pretty much the same thing.
yeah, at first that number looked low, but that's ~10k people.  i doubt there are more than 10k regular commenters here.
He'd also be able to obtain the upload timestamps from logopond.com.  Those should all predate when the scammer uploaded to the stock art site.

When the risk of something increases, do you adjust your actions accordingly?  That's the point of his alert; telling people the risk has increased.  Many people might not even have been aware there was a risk at all.

You have to admit that the first Broncos/Chargers game of last season was good. Bad calls, two-point conversions and all.
