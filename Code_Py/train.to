Dashes don't represent trailing off, which ellipses certainly provides. It might also change the meaning of the dialogue. For example, ''I can't stand Maureen,' Chet murmered. 'She...she never shaves her legs, dude.'' sounds different than: ''I can't stand Maureen,' Chet murmered. 'She--she never shaves her legs, dude.''
