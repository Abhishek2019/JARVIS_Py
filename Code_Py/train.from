We now have an Obama facepalm.  This is beyond epic.
You're right, those prison conversions are such bastions of authenticity in an otherwise jaded world...
As if any ad does that.

Yeah, in fairness, I think I was about 7.  I'd still like to pick it up some day though.  
It was fucking hard, yes. That's part of what I liked about it.
Thanks for your reply. Racial profiling seems pretty implicit though when every non-US citizen with brown skin I know (none Arab) gets stopped every time.
NO! newlinechar  newlinechar It's ME!
I don't have 6 gigabytes of L1 cache, yet I *know* that the L1 cache improves processor performance.

Let us know how you get on :)
Maybe there's more going on here then originally revealed.  If he's doing everything wrong and manipulative steps are required for any progress I'd have to ask what the hell is so great about this guy?
I'm going to take a guess without looking it up: is it the process of nerve cells in the brain establishing our sense of 'place' or position?
About 4°C for a heavy winter.  Most of the time it’s like 10–30°C.
I know!  iTunes is the only program out there that can do that!  There totally isn't anything else that does this.
I heard his name was Inigo Montoya.
Very different from regular cocaine.
Best of luck admining X-only 3rd party software without X.  Anyone who can't adapt to use new tools (like windowing systems, gui's and the like) will never get hired by our shop.  We've had prima-dona admins before.  They're just as bad as prima-dona programmers.
My dear Zeus. What the fuck school would write their site in front page?
Not even close. Its Catherine. Hi.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar edit: Well, I guess its close in the way that apple is close to ardvark.

Not to nitpick, but MySQL doesn't require a commercial license for distribution.  It requires a commercial license for non-GPL distribution.

I think the lawyers are going to have a field day defining 'severe'
And you never will.
You need a little editing help there. I think.
Hum Yellow Submarine. That always works.
I wish there were some sort of 'news aggregator' site on the internet.
I saw 100 of these in the 80s
Geez, you girls really hang out with losers. I've been married 11 years and we both still find ways to pleasantly surprise each other and not get stuck in a rut. It takes some effort though. By both sides.
 hulu I hate you with all the hate I can muster
many people, libertarian and socialist alike, conflate being pro-capitalism as being pro-business
Passing on the right is more dangerous/illegal than speeding.  That's what causes accidents.
In the ass?
You hide behind your girlfriend?
Phil McRotch would like a word with you.
Billy? Would you please clarify? 
That's sad. If my bf would let me, I'd give him head 5 times a day. Unfortunately, we have to get dressed and be productive adults :)
I would also prefer the 8th.
3.0.0.10 is what they meant. Kind of asinine versioning when you think about it, but meh. I guess it's like dotted notation for IP addresses, mostly just aesthetic.
Only if you want everyone to be confused with Michigan.
Dual? Where is this? Doesn't shake a stick at the Walter Library's computer room.

Whether or not you have anything to hide, I think you'd be pretty pissed if someone put up billboards telling lies about you.
How does one get to a situation of genuine anarchy by embracing state power?
I am not surprised. Google is used as a verb even in Finland where the language normally does not have G's.
The War on Error is damn important.
I've had an increasingly harder time connecting to Brian's viewpoints in recent episodes, I couldn't quite put my finger on it, but 'Liberal Douche' sums it up nicely.
What are they CYAing?  There has to be a valid reason behind the policy besides Richard Reid. 
But for most people their stronger arm is their main one, and for him it would be his right. He used his weaker (and probably faster) arm to hit him.
Certainly that's true.  They got much more socially oriented in their lyrics.
Similar to GWB flipping off the camera, or Wolfowitz grooming himself. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar A camera is like a gun - always assume it's live, even if it isn't.
